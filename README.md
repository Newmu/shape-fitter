============

Playing around with optimization techniques for large search spaces in the name of making cool looking images.

Starting with a similar implementation to http://alteredqualia.com/visualization/evolve/, which is based on random mutation, with the goal of getting this fast enough to use on larger photos, in end-user applications, and possibly videos? 

The decision to implement in javascript/canvas is due to the desire for having easy accessibility to anyone and also the high performance demand makes any server-side implementation un-scalable.

That, and the environment is very easy to get up and running.
